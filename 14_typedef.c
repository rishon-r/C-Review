#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

  // The typedef keyword helps us shorten the type name of struct type variables when we use them 
  // TECHNICAL DEFINITION: typedef keyword helps us create an alias (new name) for an existing type

  // E.g
  /*
    struct Person {
      char *name,
      int age
    };

    can also be written as:

    struct Person {
      char *name,
      int age
    } person;

    and then instead of writing struct Person everytime we want to initialize a variable of this struct type,
    we can simply type person = {'Michael', 23} instead of Struct Person = {'Michael', 23}

    Here, person is the alias for the struct Person type
