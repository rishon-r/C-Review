COMPILATION OF A C PROGRAM:

There are chiefly two steps to compiling a C PROGRAM

1. PREPROCESSOR: 

- Anything that starts with pound sign, hash symbol, or “octothorpe”, (#) is something the
preprocessor operates on before the compiler even gets started. 
- Common preprocessor directives, as they’re called, are #include and #define

2. COMPILATION:
- After the preprocessor is done with whatever it is supposed to do, the code is then ready for it to be converted by the compiler
into machine code or assembly code
- Source code runs through the preprocessor, then the output of that runs through the compiler, then that produces an executable for you to
run
